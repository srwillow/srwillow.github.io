    <div class="familyInfoH"><h2>Marie-Rosina et famille</h2>
        <p class="famtxt"> In 1884, Luc, 20, and Marie_Rosina, 16, married and quickly produced 2 sons.</p> 
        <p class="famtxt">In 1887, the local missionary Mauroit noted that due to an acrimonious?bitter? relationship <span style="font-style:italic">"une mauvaise intelligence entre les époux"</span> Luc moved to the US and Marie-Rosina and the boys lived with her parents in St-Cajetan.</p>
        <p class="famtxt">In 1889, Marie-Rosina moved to Ottawa, Ont for domestic work and the children were left in the care of her parents until at least 1891. NB: No 1891 census entries were found for these four. Her parents list Jules Emard and his wife Adelaïde but do not list any of the 3 extra children known to be living with them - Joseph, Magloire and Jean-Baptiste, Adelaïde's illegitimate son.</p>
        
        <p class="famtxt">By 1899, the couple seem to have reconciled and were living at 161 Dalhousie, Ottawa with their eldest son, Joseph Potvin. No explicit location for Magloire has been found at this time.</p>
        <p class="famtxt">In the 1901 Census, Luc, 'single', was propecting in Northern Ontario and Marie_Rosina - now listed as Mary Forest, 'widow' living with Joseph at 161-163 Dalhousie until her death in 1903. NB: only census options were : married, single, divorced, widow.</p>
        <p clas="famtxt">In 1906, Luc successfully remarries and in 1907 hits 'gold mine' paydirt.</p>

    <p class=familyInfoH> OBSERVATIONS</p>
        <ol class="observ">
            <li><p> <span style="font-style:bold">Question : did Joseph (later known as Auguste) and Magloire ever reconcile with Luc and/or Rosina?</span>
            <p>
            Answer highly likely.
            <ol type="A" class="observ-1"> <li>Joseph's Ottawa, Ont. death certificate lists Magloire of Sudbury as his informant - so it is likely they stayed close.</li> 
            <li> In 1899 Ottawa Directory, Luc Emard 'mining man' and his son Joseph Potvin 'miner' are both living at 161 Dalhousie. Could it be that Joseph spent time prospecting with Luc?</li> <li> Luc attends Magloire's 1909 wedding in Sudbury and signs with an 'X' (his mark).</li>
            <li> Magloire lists Luc Potvin as his "nearest relative" point of contact when he and his family immigrate to the US.</li>
            <li> Magloire, likely having died in Michigan, US, is listed as 'brother' on his half-brother Lionel's headstone in McFarlane Cemetery, Ont.</li>
            </ol></li>
            <li><p>We know Vital and at least 1 of his children had travelled from St-Cajetan, Aumond to Bytown (Ottawa) and Hull. This chapter shows a direct link between Bytown/Ottawa and EdP members, including Luc&amp;family and his brother Adelard &amp; family.</p></li>
        <li><p> Although both sons are listed under various combinations of Emard and Potvin : Joseph &amp; descendants are Emard. Magloire &amp; descendants are Potvin. All younger half-siblings and descendants are Potvin. </p></li>

    <div class="familyInfoH1"><h2>M1-#1 : Auguste Emard et famille</h2>
        <p class="famtxt">Although baptised in 1885 as Joseph Antoine Emard, he was often named Joseph and later Auguste. By 1898 he was listed as living with his father Luc at 161 Dalhousie, Ottawa and in 1901 with his mother at the same address.</p>
        <p class="famtxt"> By 1911, single and 24 years old, Auguste Potvin was lodging at 300 Water St, Ottawa (now Bruyère) with Alphonse Boucher and family. He  worked as a driver.</p> 
        <p class="famtxt"> Joseph Auguste Emard-dit-Potvin married Eva Doré in 1913 and by 1918 the couple had produced 2 children. In 1916, they lived at 312 Water St.(now demolished).</p>
        <p class="famtxt">    On January 02, 1919, he died of Influenza within 8 days of diagnosis - a victim of the pandemic Spanish Flu. His wife died 3 years later - cause TBD. They are buried in the Notre-Dame Cemetery, Ottawa, section 15-4.</p>
        <p class="famtxt">From Auguste's son Aurèle's 2006 obituary, the Emard family line continues with 2 male Emard great-great-grand-children and many other gggchildren, and at least some still living in the Ottawa-Orleans area.</p>

         <p class="famtxt">
         Magloire Emard-dit-Potvin was born in St-Cajetan and later nicknamed Mack. He and his brother lived with his maternal grand-parents in St-Cajetan until at least 1891.</p> 
         <p class="famtxt">His whereabouts are unknown until 1909 when Magloire Potvin, 22, married Léonide Tremblay, 18, at the Saint-Anne-des-Pins church in Sudbury. His father signed with 'X' his mark; Rosina Forest noted as dead. Within 2 months, their first child was born and 4 others followed in quick succession.</p>
        <p class="famtxt"> The family immigrated to Detroit, Michigan in 1926 - Luke Potvin of Sudbury was listed as the main point of contact.</p>
        <p class="famtxt">Léonide finalized her divorce from Magloire in 1930 on the basis of extreme cruelty and non-support. The divorce was not contested and alimony was granted. Joseph 18, Mack 17, Edward 12, Leonide 15, Evelyn 9.</p>
         <p class="famtxt">In 1940, Mack Sr. was living with his married son Mack Potvin Jr, 27, and son Edward Potvin, 22. </p>
         <p class="famtxt">Magloire Mack Potvin's 1942 US War Registration card : 53 yrs old, unemployed, 5'2", blue eyes, grey (black) hair, 120lbs, ruddy complexion.</p>
          <p class="famtxt">In 1939, his eldest Joseph Luc Potvin moved to Canada - likely Sudbury having listed his uncle Mr. Joe Tremblay as nearest relative. He returned to Detroit in 1946, the year Magloire died. Perhaps Magloire had moved back to Sudbury with Joseph? He is buried with his step-brother Lionel and wife Berthe Belizle in the McFarlane cemetery, Ont. The children and grand-children continue the Potvin line in Michigan.</p>
         
         <p class="famtxt">He listed several occupations  : farmer, laborer, brakeman, auto parts paint grainer.</p>
